## Browser Compatibility

The extension is designed to work on multiple browsers:

- **Chrome**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support with Firefox-specific adaptations
- **Safari**: Full support with Safari-specific adaptations

## Development

### Prerequisites

- macOS (for Safari extension development)
- Bash shell
- Node.js and npm (for React Flow components)
- Basic knowledge of web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

### Building React Flow Components

This extension includes React Flow components for the AI brainstorming feature. To build these components:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Build for development (with watch mode):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The built files will be placed in the `dist/` directory and are automatically referenced by `brainstorm.html`.

### Project Structure

```
Resources/
├── _locales/            # Localization files
├── dist/                # Build output directory (created during build)
├── manifest-chrome.json # Chrome-specific manifest
├── manifest-firefox.json # Firefox-specific manifest
├── manifest-safari.json # Safari-specific manifest
├── scripts/             # Build and utility scripts
│   └── build.sh         # Main build script
├── version.txt          # Current version of the extension
└── [JavaScript files]   # Extension functionality
```

### Building the Extension

The project includes a comprehensive build script (`scripts/build.sh`) that handles the build process for all supported browsers.

#### Basic Commands

```bash
# Build the extension for all browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
./scripts/build.sh build

# Build with a specific version number
./scripts/build.sh build 6.1.0

# Clean the build directory
./scripts/build.sh clean

# Build and watch for changes (development mode)
./scripts/build.sh dev chrome  # For Chrome
./scripts/build.sh dev firefox # For Firefox
./scripts/build.sh dev safari  # For Safari
```

#### Version Management

The build script automatically manages versioning:

- Reads the current version from `version.txt`
- Increments the patch version by default if no version is specified
- Prevents accidental version downgrades
- Updates all manifest files with the correct version
- Updates `version.txt` with the new version after building

### Development Workflow

1. Make changes to the source files in the `Resources` directory
2. Run the build script in development mode for your target browser:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh dev chrome
   ```
3. The script will watch for changes and automatically rebuild when files are modified
4. Test your changes in the browser

## Technologies and Approaches

### Core Technologies

- **JavaScript**: Core extension functionality
- **jQuery**: DOM manipulation and event handling
- **Chrome Extension API**: Browser integration
- **Web Extension API**: Cross-browser compatibility

### Key Approaches

- **Browser Detection**: The extension detects the current browser and adapts its behavior accordingly
- **Content Scripts**: Used to inject Buffer functionality into web pages
- **Background Scripts**: Manage extension state and handle browser events
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Manifest files and code adaptations for different browsers
- **Site-Specific Integrations**: Custom code for popular social media platforms
- **Storage API**: Uses Chrome's storage API for persistent settings

## Extension Components

### Background Script

The `background.js` file serves as the main controller for the extension, handling:
- Initial setup
- Context menu creation
- Browser action configuration
- Message passing between components
- Dark/light mode detection

### Content Scripts

Various content scripts provide site-specific functionality:
- `buffer-twitter.js`: Twitter/X.com integration
- `buffer-reddit.js`: Reddit integration
- `buffer-pinterest.js`: Pinterest integration
- `buffer-hn.js`: Hacker News integration
- `buffer-hover-button.js`: Image sharing functionality

### User Interface

- `popup.js`: Controls the main popup interface
- `options.js`: Manages user preferences
- `toggle-icon.js`: Handles icon changes based on theme

### Utilities

- `get-selection.js`: Extracts selected text from web pages
- `get-title.js`: Retrieves page titles
- `keymaster.js`: Keyboard shortcut handling
